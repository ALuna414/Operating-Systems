# Operating-Systems
• Explain the objectives and functions of modern operating systems.
• Know how operating systems have evolved over time from primitive batch systems 
  to sophisticated multi-user systems.
• Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using interrupt processing.
• Describe the need for concurrency.
• Demonstrate the potential run-time problems arising from the concurrent operation 
  of many separate tasks.
• Create state and transition diagrams for simple problem domains.
• Explain conditions that lead to deadlocks.
• Compare and contrast the common algorithms used for both preemptive and non-
  preemptive scheduling of tasks in operating systems.
• Describe relationships between scheduling algorithms and application domains.
• Discuss the need for preemption and deadline scheduling.
• Explain memory hierarchy and cost-performance tradeoffs.
• Summarize the principles of virtual memory as applied to caching, paging, and 
  segmentation.
• Describe the performance metrics used to determine how a system performs.
• Compare and contrast the common algorithms used for disk scheduling.
• Analyze the performance of different implementations in a variety of settings via 
  simulation experiments.
• Implement system calls.
